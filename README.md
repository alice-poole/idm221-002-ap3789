This is the repository for https://drexeldnd.com, a resource website for the Drexel Gaming Association's Dungeons and Dragons division.
This website can be expanded to include any number of new setting locations and external resources as-needed for the use of the club.
As I am withdrawing from my position as the club's D&D Officer, I hope this resource can be used by any future officers or members.
For any inquiries or addition requests, please contact Alice Poole via Drexel email.
