            <p>
                Leilon's a gamble. Its citizens like it that way. On the one hand, it's a den of danger, evil, and monstrous folk.
                On the other hand, it's the best reprieve from the actual dens of dangerous evil monsters that litter the surrounding swamps.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This seaside town was loyal to the Skeleton Lord in the war. Makes sense, given the whole marsh full of undead.
                Even though the Pale Cult lost, word is some are still loyal to its cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leilon locals are tough as nails: pirates, traders, adventurers, and thieves.
                The newly arrived group of royal Neverwinter settlers hoping to rebuild it will have to be tougher.

            </h3> 
            <p>

            </h3> 
            <p>
                A hotspot before the town's destruction, the Knight's Goblet has been rebuilt as a rest stop for merchants and wealthy travelers to spend the night. No weapons are permitted inside.

            </h3> 
            <p>
                This half-crumbled wizard's tower used to watch over the town - literally. According to Neverwinter reports, it was turned into a giant magical weapon in the war.

                This harbor hosts the Barge Yard and Fishery, where salty sailors do their work and try to ignore the smell. Some trade stories of unfathomable sea monsters and worse.
