            <br>
            <p>
                The village of Phandalin was once a bustling town of miners, wizards, and magic item crafters. Now, at least it's something.
                Destroyed by decades of orc invasions and several wars, the Heart of the Valley finds itself at peace for the first time in memory.
                In the center of the old fieldstone ruins, brave settlers decided to build again.
            </p>
            <p>
                New cabins have begun to grow from the old foundations.
                Old tracks frame the dirt road into the dusty village square, where strange cracks in the Earth tell stories of great battles long forgotten.
                It seems every day now, new travelers move to New Phandalin in search of home and new fortune: miners, loggers, merchants, and even adventurers.

                LOCATIONS
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>
                Stonehill Inn
            </h3> 
            <p>
                The local inn and tavern where travelers, residents, and adventurers meet. Its kindly human owner, Toblen Stonehill, will quickly remind you he's not a dwarf - he's just short.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Phandalin Miner's Exchange
            </h3> 
            <p>
                A general store to exchange treasures for coin. The store is run by the suspicious and cunning Halia Thornton, a sharp-tongued human woman with dark hair pulled tight. Rumor is she burned down the competition.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Lionshield Coster
            </h3> 
            <p>
                A chain store of a thriving merchant company. While it lacks the local touch, the clean and orderly Lionshield Coster sells everything the Phandalin Miner's Exchange can, and at competitive prices. Lionshield Coster is the only place in the village that sells weapons, too. Linene Graywind, its franchisee, is a daring woman who takes pride in her shop.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Magyck by Cecili
            </h3> 
            <p>
                A new addition to Phandalin, this boutique magic item workshop is built on the ruins of Old Owl Well. Cecili Sparkles is a gnomish inventor, artiste, celebrity, total gnomeboss, voted Neverwinter's Top 300 Under 300. She can produce a magic item for any request for the right price, given time.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Shrine of Luck
            </h3> 
            <p>
                A simple shrine made stones. While dedicated to Tymora, the Goddess of Luck, travelers have left small coins and trinkets of any god they follow. Elven acolyte Sister Garaele is happy her shrine-turned-wishing-well is a place of worship and good fortune for the whole village.
