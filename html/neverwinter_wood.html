            <p>
                Neverwinter Wood may never be fully understood by mortals. The elves called it Llewyrrwood. 
                The worshippers of Helm called it the Watcher's Forest. The woodsmen of Phandalin call it an opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                What became of the elves, no-one knows. 
                But brave travelers of the wood tell tales of terrible owlbears, strange druids, and elusive unicorns. 
                Some believers swear they can feel real magic in the air. Skeptics say it's the beauty of the forest air and rushing river.
                One way or another, everyone can agree: it's certainly a magical place.

            <h3>
                Neverwinter River
            </h3> 
            <p>
                Old elves built their ancestral villages along this river. It flows from Mount Hotenow through the whole forest. Some claim its fresh water has magical healing properties.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Mount Hotenow
            </h3> 
            <p>
                This old volcano erupted a century ago, tragically wiping out the village of Thundertree.

                Cragmaw Castle
            </h3> 
            <p>
                Abandoned during the eruption of Mount Hotenow, this keep has since been taken over by a hobgoblin tribe.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Agatha's Grove
            </h3> 
            <p>
                Nestled in the thorny wastes by the ghost town of Conyberry, local legends say a certain forest hut is still home to a banshee obsessed with fate.
